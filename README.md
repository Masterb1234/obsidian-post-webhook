## Usage

### Setting Up Webhooks

4. Configure attachment and context note options per Webhook

### Sending Content

#### Full Notes
1. Open any note

3. Search for "Send to [Webhook Name]"
4. Your note's content, frontmatter, and attachments will be sent

### YAML Frontmatter Support

The plugin automatically parses YAML frontmatter and includes it in the Webhook payload. Example note:

```yaml
---
title: My Note
tags: [Webhook, automation]
category: tech
exclude-attachment: attachment1.mp3  # Exclude a single attachment
# OR exclude multiple attachments:
exclude-attachment:
  - image1.png
  - document.pdf
---
Your note content here...

![attachment.png]
```

Will be sent as:

```json
{
  "title": "My Note",
  "tags": ["Webhook", "automation"],
  "category": "tech",
  "content": "Your note content here...\n\n![attachment.png]",
  "filename": "note.md",
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "attachments": [
    {
      "name": "attachment.png",
      "type": "png",
      "size": 12345,
      "data": "base64_encoded_data..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Attachment Support

The plugin automatically:
- Detects attachments referenced in your notes using the `![[filename]]` syntax
- Reads the attachment files
- Converts them to Base64
- Includes them in the Webhook payload
- Supports images and other file types
- Allows excluding specific attachments via YAML frontmatter

For Webhooks where attachments are not necessary or might exceed the endpoint's file size limits, you can enable the "Exclude Attachments" option in the Webhook settings. All attachments will be omitted from requests to this endpoint.

### Context Notes

Context notes enable you to create reusable content blocks that can be seamlessly integrated into your Webhook requests. This feature is especially useful for incorporating prompt templates stored in your Obsidian vault when processing webhook data.

To use variable notes:

1. Create a note with the following structure:
```
---
post-webhook: true
---
--[user]
Your user-specific content here

--[system]
Your system instructions here

--[prompt]
Your prompt template here
```

2. Enable "Include Context Note" for your Webhook
3. When sending content, you'll be prompted to select a context note
4. The variables (separated by --[keyword]) will be included in the Webhook payload

### Response Handling

The plugin can automatically insert Webhook responses into your notes:

1. Enable "Attach Response" in Webhook settings
2. When sending a note/selection, responses are handled based on their type:
   - Text responses are inserted directly
   - JSON responses are formatted in code blocks
   - Binary files (images, PDFs, etc.) are saved and linked appropriately

## Use Cases

### Email Integration
Send emails directly from your Obsidian notes using n8n workflows. Write your email content in Obsidian, include recipients and subject in the frontmatter, and send it to your email workflow with a single command. [Template here](https://n8n.io/workflows/2591-send-emails-via-gmail-from-obsidian/)

### Smart Airtable Queries
Query your Airtable bases using natural language. Highlight a question in your note, send it to an n8n workflow that uses GPT to interpret your query, and get formatted Airtable data inserted directly into your note. [Template here](https://n8n.io/workflows/2615-get-airtable-data-via-ai-and-obsidian-notes/)
